# Non-abundant sums
# Problem 23
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=23

# A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
# exactly equal to the number.
# For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
# = 28,
# which means that 28 is a perfect number.

# A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than
# n
# and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

# As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16,
# the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is
# 24.
# By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than
# 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
# However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis
# even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot
# be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

# Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum
# of two abundant numbers.
